        <strong className='intro.A'>Hello! I'm Edward,</strong> a web developer with a fervent passion for creating fun, interactive, and visually appealing digital experiences. My coding adventure began in an unconventional manner 
            â€“ sparked by a friend's simple question, "Why don't you teach yourself how to code?" That query ignited a curiosity within me, leading me down a path of self-discovery and endless learning in
             the vast universe of web development. <br /><br />

 <span className='tab'></span>I've since become proficient in technologies such as React.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, with a particular affinity for CSS and its extensions like SASS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. These tools have become my
 palette for painting the web in more vibrant, dynamic colors, making each project more enjoyable than the last. <br /><br />

 <span className='tab'></span>Among the myriad of small projects that have marked my journey, my favorite has been developing a JavaScript game where players save a town from a dragon's wrath. This project, while entertaining, has also been
 a sandbox for innovation, challenging me to think creatively and plan future enhancements. <br /><br />

 <span className='tab'></span>My journey has not been without its challenges, notably the tendency to overextend myself in the thirst for knowledge. Learning to code across multiple languages and frameworks simultaneously often led to
 feeling overwhelmed. Recognizing the importance of focus, I've learned to step back, reassess, and concentrate on what truly matters at each step of my learning process. This self-awareness and ability to
  refocus have been crucial in my development as a coder. <br /><br />

 <span className='tab'></span>Beyond the world of code, I express my creativity through music as a bassist and trumpeter, playing in bands that have released some of our tunes. Additionally, my work as a bartender and pursuit of mixology excellence
 keeps me creative and grounded, ensuring I'm not tethered to my desk indefinitely. <br /><br />

 <span className='tab'></span>As I continue on this exhilarating journey of coding and creativity, I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations. Whether it's developing innovative web solutions or brainstorming
 the next big idea, I'm ready for the challenge. Let's make the web a more enjoyable place together!</p>
